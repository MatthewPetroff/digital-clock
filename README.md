### Summary

Digital clock that displays the current time in HH:MM:SS format. 

The date is displayed below the clock in Day MMM DD format.

This is the my first full project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The biggest takeaway for me was seeing what it takes to bring a basic app from conception to a final working form.
